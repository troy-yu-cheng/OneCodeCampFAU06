    <h1>The Importance of <em>Exercise</em></h1>
    <h4>
      In today's sedentary lifestyle, exercise has become more important than
      ever. With increasing reliance on technology and desk-bound jobs, physical
      activity is often neglected, leading to a host of health issues.
      <s>It's time to break this cycle.</s>
    </h4>
    <h2>Benefits of Regular <u>Exercise</u></h2>
    <h4>
      Regular exercise offers numerous benefits for both physical and mental
      well-being:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Physical Health:</strong> <em>Exercise</em> helps
        maintain a healthy weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as
        heart disease and diabetes, and strengthens muscles and bones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Mental Health:</strong> Physical activity releases
        endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that help improve mood and
        reduce stress and anxiety. <sup>[1]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Regular exercise boosts energy
        levels and reduces feelings of fatigue, helping individuals stay active
        and productive throughout the day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Better Sleep:</strong> <em>Exercise</em> promotes better sleep
        quality, helping individuals fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper, more
        restorative sleep.
      </li>
    </ul>
